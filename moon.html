    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one of the most recognizable objects in the night sky. It's about
        one-quarter the size of Earth and is primarily made of rock. The Moon's surface is covered in craters,
        mountains, valleys, and large, dark plains called maria, which are basaltic lava flows. It lacks an atmosphere,
        which means it cannot support life and has extreme temperature variations. The Moon is in synchronous rotation
        with Earth, showing only one face to us. It's about 384,400 km away from Earth and plays a crucial role in
        influencing Earth's tides. Its phases, caused by the changing angles of sunlight hitting its surface, take about
        29.5 days to complete.</p>
