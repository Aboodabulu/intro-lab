    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. It has a diverse
        environment, ranging from polar ice caps to hot deserts. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water,
        mostly in the form of oceans. The atmosphere, composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, provides necessary
        conditions for life and protects living organisms from harmful solar radiation. Earth has a layered structure,
        including a crust, mantle, and core. It orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days, a period known as a year, and
        rotates on its axis every 24 hours, creating day and night cycles. Earth's complex ecosystem and climate are
        influenced by its interactions with the Sun and the Moon.</p>
